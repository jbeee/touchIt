<h2><a href=" http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/examples/carousel.html">11. Sun Dies, Blood Moon</a></h2>


Have no fear and open your eyes and observe the glowing room
Through the blood that runs through your eyelids, I guess it’s time to wake
Moving hours with vacant hands just for the chance just to sleep again
Drag my feet across the earth yeah I guess that nothings restored
Make my through my designer home
To the heart of my captivity
Where I am both prisoner and warden
All I need is the air inside my lungs, or a cigarette
Life is blank without the flame.
It’s ok cause I am still within the womb
Watching from the inside, the inside
The great things wait just past the horizon
They lose their glow when the lights hit their skin
Outstretched hands I’ll flee and to nothing I will open the door.

The sun is dead, or maybe just fading out
It hits my skin for the first time in days and days
As I slip into the air I feel the warmest winter
That I can remember
Breathless is the empty world
Aimlessly walking through a vacant city
The architecture is all alone
If this is the end I don’t feel a damn thing
My tired feet matter no more
It seems the things I tend to believe always fall to my feet
To dig my shallow graves
You must have felt this, before you even woke up
You should have known it years ago
Do not be surprised my friend
You make your own decisions
You worked hard, you fought the good fight
The taste of copper in a failed mouth full of broken teeth
And the sounds of excuses
I’ll count my blessings on the fingers of the unbit hand
Empty of reason, goodbyes on the tip of my tongue forever
And so it goes
I must have seen it, before I even woke up
I should have known it years ago
I will storm the gates of hell
I will kill the queen of death herself
Shadowless in the last direct light of the drowning sun.

<h2>10. Funeral Singer</h2>


It’s been so many years since the first time I died.
The vultures have been gone for so long
The past starts again
But now it’s all been covered in ash
Dust yourself off and shine your bones cause
We’ve got a long way to go
I am the king of love to hate
You said we’d be together forever
I hope my candor doesn’t piss you off
But I wasn’t joking
Forever’s the last word I want to hear come out of your mouth
You are unchanged, why?
And no matter how it looks
I’m just now realizing they look better awake
Then they ever did asleep
The pieces are bursting together
I’ve been trying for so long to place them
Circles inside squares sparing and spoiling…
And now finally I’ve left
Burning and gasping for life
You’re drowning, but you’re not, you won’t
You are unchanged, why? Unchanged. How?
This is the only way. Spit out the candles that keep me away from you.
This is not an invitation. This is my plea.
I want to lay down in the trap you set for me
And wait in peace for you
I’m bleeding from the inside but nothing can protect myself from you
I want to lay down next to you and forget the world
The only people that exist are you and I.
I want to look you in the eyes and count my blessings
You are so much more than just my other half
I’m telling you right now, I’d sell my soul for you.

<h2>9. Triffids</h2>


This is a romance!
This is a fiction, it’s a friend
That we all, we want to take to the grave
But this isn’t going to end well
This is a fable
Brought to you before a live studio audience
And it was created by adolescents
Singing “Cash that check and check that cash that check”
No one says that fear is a liar
But I’ve been told “No one gets out alive
So trust us with your life
The conclusion of the world is coming!
As soon as we have enough provisions
Plus management is God
And they’re behind it all
Silence shows nothing but weakness”
By now you’ve chosen the end
To live in fear is to not live at all
Worry is no form of treatment
You lost the sun to the walls of your bunker
But my love you know that I feel the same way
The only difference that fear is a liar
But at the top no one gets out alive
So trust us with your life
The conclusion of the world is coming!
As soon as we have enough provisions
Plus management is God
And they’re behind it all
Silence shows nothing but weakness
No one gets away alive!
By now you’ve stepped off the edge
This is a ROMANCE!!!!
Darling you know that I feel the same way

<h2>8. Neck In The Hemp</h2>


I’m only gonna tell you one time! I am absolutely over you
But the fact remains that I was never beneath you
So just give me one reason to fall in line
Cause at the end of the day I just forget to care
I just forget you exist and I move on
Oh yeah, one more thing, and you should write this down
My patience is thick but the fuse has been cut
And the vital flame has been replaced
And while you’re at it can you autograph this DNR?
Don’t you worry there’s a carbon print for my records.
I’ll be sure to keep it safe and sound.
For the love of God, do not resuscitate
You are the heir of a neck in the hemp
I am the son of a gun that has the rope
That’s not a wall I’d want to hide behind.
It’s not getting any younger and it’s about to fall
I’ll be on the other side pushing as hard as I can
Let’s not have any doubts about this I will celebrate from your….
Death is not the rebellion of life!
</span>
<span class="colors" id="c4">
<h2>7. The Lash Whistled Like A Singing Wind</h2>
Our friendship has a white flag
I’ll surrender if that’s what it takes
But I’ll never admit defeat
If that’s the road then you have the map
You and I mean way less to me than anything
In the isolation of the thoughts and judgments
And whatever happens to be spewing out of your dependency jail
There’s a slow dance soiree of trouble and you threw the party
We’re all doused in gasoline with no fear of flame
Well there’s a lot of things that can start a fire
I hope you’re satisfied because we all know that it’s the last thing
That I’ll hide and it’s the last that you can expect
No! You make your own damn mistakes!
</span>
<span class="colors" id="c5">
<h2>6. Afterhour Animals</h2>
Relax, you are loved
Breathe in and breath out
You are warm, loved, and comfortable
Focus on your breathing, breathe deeply and evenly
Lay back, close your eyes
Relax and listen, to my voice
You will sink deeper and deeper into total calm, comfortable, silence
Inside you will feel clean, clear, perfect, and still.
