    jQuery widget to solve the <a href="http://www.stucox.com/blog/you-cant-detect-a-touchscreen/">
    greatest question
    </a> plaguing humanity in the history of ever.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h1>Was that your <i>mouse</i> or your <i>finger</i>?</h1>

    </p>
    <p>
    Detecting touch capability in general has been raising issues all over the place.<br>
    <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/548">https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/548</a><br>
    So, if used at all, they must be used very carefully<br>
    Make sure the site you're building is still relatively functional even if touch/mouse detection fails<br>
    (Note: The issue of windows phones has not been addressed with this plugin... or any plugin/method I have found.)<br>
    The first several tests aren't really definitive of anything.<br>
    More for completeness than functionality<br><br>
    If you decide to encorporate the widget in your project, use the optimized versions here:
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>The Algorithm:</h2>
    <h3>The Failing Tests</h3>
     <ul>
         <li>
             <strong>It checks the user agent.</strong>
             This doesn't really tell you anything about a touch capable laptop, but if it flags ipad/iphone/blackberry/android then touch-only is a safe bet. Hide the mouseover events! Hide them all.<br>
             However, touch-capable desktops exist, and user agents can be faked.
             </li>
          <li>
             <i>This method, btw, is how HULU.com checks whether you're on a phone/tablet or a computer<br> So if you'd like to watch Hulu on your phone and don't want to pay for hulu plus, just change your browsers user agent to 'desktop.'</i>
         </li>
         <li>
             <strong>It checks for touch capability.</strong>
             On non-IE browsers, if touch is not detected, then it's a pretty safe bet that the user is using a mouse<br>
             (On IE checking pointer types instead)<br>
             However, mobile browsers have been known to throw false negatives, and Desktop browsers, false posatives.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>It checks the height/width ratio for portrait mode</strong>
            I'm totally lying to you right now, all it does is check if the media querie for protrait mode is flagged.
            If it's in portrait mode, it's probably a tablet/phone.<br>
            However, portrait mode proves nothing.<br>
            When I turn my MS Surface sideways, I can still use the mouse.<br>
            I can also be really into resizing things.<br>            
            That being said, if its less then 800px wide, it's probably phone/tablet (non-HD).<br>            
         </li>
         <li>
         <strong>Check if touch.events exist</strong>
         The current modernizr solution for touch detection checks if the touch.events exist at all.<br>
         If they do, then we have touch. If not, then no touch.<br>
         However, <a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/features/ces-2014-hybrids-laptops-and-ultrabooks-roundup-469808"><u>mouse and touch aren't mutually exclusive!</u></a>

         <br>
         Ideally, the UI should respond to each appropriately, but never assume anything.
         </li>
         </ul>
 
        <h3>The Proposed Solution</h3>
             <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>It listens(continually) for touch.events, mouse.events, and MS IE pointer.events</strong>            
            If a touch/(non-mouse type pointer)event is detected, enable touch functions and hide your hovers (and other mouse-only functions)<br>
            If a mouse/(pointer.type == mouse) event is detected, do your mouse-only things<br>
          </li>
         <li>
            <i>The draw back is that it must keep listening. 
            <br> Not the most efficient thing in the world, but in case your user goes from mouse to touch then back to mouse, you're covered<br></i>
         </li>
         <li>
         <i>
            Since webkit/moz touch.events throw mouse events too, a function with a quick timeout blocks the capture of mouse.events immediately after touch.events are fired.
          </i>
         </li>
        </ul>
